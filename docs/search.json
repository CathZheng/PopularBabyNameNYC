    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe choice of a baby’s name is often influenced by a variety of factors, including cultural traditions, family heritage, popular culture, and societal trends. In exploring the dataset of popular baby names in New York City, this project aims to uncover patterns and trends in naming practices across different sexes and ethnic groups over time. Understanding these patterns can provide insights into the cultural and social dynamics of the city, reflect the changing demographics, and highlight the influence of cultural events and media.\nThe questions we’re asking are simple but tell a big story. What are the most popular names overall and within each ethnic group? How does the diversity of names compare between genders? Is there a trend in the length of names over the years, gender or ethinic groups? These aren’t just names on a page; they’re a snapshot of New York’s identity, showing us how the city’s unique mix of people come together and evolve.\nWhy focus on New York? The city is always changing, and so are the names parents are picking for their kids. This isn’t just about looking at lists of names and which ones are in the top ten. It’s about looking at the bigger picture, seeing how our world shapes us, right down to the names we choose.\nSo this project is not just for data crunching. It’s a window into real life, into the homes and families that make up New York City. By looking at what parents name their babies, we can see reflections of the city’s diversity, its trends, and its transformations. As a graduate research project, it’s a chance to apply exploratory data analysis to understand something deeply human — the names we give our children and what those names say about the world they’re born into.\nIn this introduction, we’re setting up the journey we’re about to take through the city’s naming patterns. We’re going to look at what the data tells us and try to make sense of it all in a way that’s as interesting and complex as the city itself. Let’s see what the names say, not just to the parents who choose them, but to all of us who are part of this city’s ongoing story."

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nThe data source for this project is drawn from the NYC OpenData portal, specifically the dataset published by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. It is a comprehensive collection of civil birth registration records in New York City. The dataset is updated annually from 2011 to 2019. This dataset is updated on an annual basis, covering a span from 2011 to 2019. The data is presented in a structured format, comprising 57,582 rows and 6 columns. The columns are labeled as Year of Birth, Gender, Ethnicity, Child's First Name, Count, and Rank. Year of Birth is the year when the baby is born. Gender is the sex of the baby. The Ethnicity column reflects the child’s mother’s ethnicity, which adds a layer of socio-cultural context to the data. The Count indicates the number of babies given a particular name in a specific year, while Rank represents the popularity of names in descending order for each year.\n\nUpon preliminary inspection, it has been observed that the dataset contains some identical rows within the same year. We plan to combine these identical rows by adding up their counts.\n\nFor importing the data into our analysis environment, we have already downloaded the dataset in a CSV file format from the NYC OpenData portal.\n\nThis is the data source page: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Popular-Baby-Names/25th-nujf"

    "text": "2.2 Research plan\n\nWhat are the most popular names overall and within each ethnic group?\nBy grouping on the names and aggregate the counts together, it will show the overall popularity of names and we will see which names are most popular across all groups. Then aggregating the counts of names across the years and within ethnic groups, we can identify the popularity of names within each ethnic group, offering insights into cultural preferences and traditions in naming. To visually represent these trends, we plan to use heatmaps to show the frequency of names across different ethnic groups and highlight patterns. other graphs like bar charts to compare the popularity of different names over time and across different ethnic groups. \nHow does the diversity of names compare between genders?\nWe first plan to assess the diversity by calculating the number of unique names per gender. We also plan to understand the frequency distribution of names for each gender. A high concentration of babies with a small set of names may indicate lower diversity. We could use chi-square test to determine if the differences in name variaty between genders are statistically significant, not just random. It might also be insightful to examine how the diversity of names has changed over time for each gender. We will use some plots to to see if diversity is increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable.\n\nIs there a trend in the length of names over the years? First, create a new column that represent the length of each name and then calculate the average length of name for each year. Plot the graph and see if there’s an increasing or decreasing pattern in the length of names over the years. Also explore if there are different trends in name length among genders or ethnicity. This can reveal whether naming conventions for boys and girls have evolved differently over time or cultural preferences in name lengths."

    "text": "3.2 For the Overall and Within-Group Popularity of Names\n\n3.2.1 Faceted histogram for name counts by ethnicity\n\n\nCode\nggplot(combined_data, aes(x=Total_Count)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=30, fill=\"blue\", color=\"black\") +\n  facet_wrap(~Ethnicity, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(x=\"Total Count of Names\", y=\"Frequency\", title=\"Faceted Histogram of Name Counts by Ethnicity\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above histograms show the distribution of the total count of names within different ethnic groups in this dataset. Each small plot (facet) represents a different ethnic group.The x-axis shows the range of the total counts for names. This is how many times a particular name appears in dataset. The y-axis shows the frequency, which is the number of names that fall within each bin of the total counts. For example, if there’s a bar reaching up to 150 on the y-axis at the 500 mark on the x-axis, this means there are 150 different names that have a total count of around 500 in that ethnic group.All histograms show a right-skewed distribution. This means that most names within each ethnic group have a relatively low count, while a few names have a very high count. In other words, there is a diverse range of name popularity across ethnic groups, with most names being relatively rare (low count), and a few names being very common (high count).\n\n\n3.2.2 Boxplot to compare the distribution of name popularity by different years\n\n\nCode\nggplot(combined_data, aes(x=as.factor(Year.of.Birth), y=Total_Count)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x=\"Year of Birth\", y=\"Total Count of Names\", title=\"Boxplot of Name Popularity by Year of Birth\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplots compare the distribution of name popularity by year of birth.Each box represents a year from 2011 to 2019. The Y-axis represents the count of how often each name occurs. A higher count indicates more popularity.The years 2011-2014 show greater variability in the total counts of names, as indicated by the longer boxes and whiskers. This suggests there was a wider disparity in name popularity during these years.Years 2015-2019 show less variability with much shorter boxes and whiskers, indicating that name popularity was more consistent within these years — fewer names with very high or very low counts.\n\n\n3.2.3 Ridgeline plot for name popularity across different years\n\n\nCode\nggplot(combined_data, aes(x=Total_Count, y=as.factor(Year.of.Birth), fill=as.factor(Year.of.Birth))) +\n  geom_density_ridges() +\n  labs(x=\"Total Count of Names\", y=\"Year of Birth\", title=\"Ridgeline Plot of Name Popularity Across Years\")\n\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 10.8\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of name counts for each year is skewed to the right, meaning there are a few names with very high counts and many with lower counts.The peak of the ridges appears to shift slightly from year to year, indicating changes in the popularity distribution of names.Some years, like 2018, show a narrower peak, which could suggest a more uniform distribution of name popularity for that year compared to others. We can see ridges of 2011-2014 are much wider than others at the base, it suggests a greater variety of names with lower counts for those years (consistent conclusion with box plot).\n\n\n3.2.4 Check the distribution of First letter of First name\nStore each first name’s first letter in column First_Letter\n\n\nCode\ncombined_data$First_Letter &lt;- substr(combined_data$Child.s.First.Name, 1, 1)\n\n\nNow, aggregate to get the total count for each first letter, store in a new dataframe\n\n\nCode\nfirst_letter_counts &lt;- combined_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(First_Letter) %&gt;%\n  summarize(Total_Count = sum(Total_Count, na.rm = TRUE))\nhead(first_letter_counts, 10)\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   First_Letter Total_Count\n   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;int&gt;\n 1 a                 300756\n 2 b                  57961\n 3 c                 110384\n 4 d                  81661\n 5 e                 146610\n 6 f                  21707\n 7 g                  55640\n 8 h                  39644\n 9 i                  52483\n10 j                 231395\n\n\nOrder the Total_Count by descending order\n\n\nCode\n# Order the data frame by Count in descending order\nfirst_letter_counts &lt;- first_letter_counts[order(-first_letter_counts$Total_Count),]\nhead(first_letter_counts, 10)\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   First_Letter Total_Count\n   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;int&gt;\n 1 a                 300756\n 2 j                 231395\n 3 m                 198012\n 4 e                 146610\n 5 s                 145342\n 6 l                 117731\n 7 c                 110384\n 8 d                  81661\n 9 n                  71296\n10 k                  65935\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(first_letter_counts, aes(x=reorder(First_Letter, -Total_Count), y=Total_Count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", fill='lightblue') +\n  coord_flip() +  # This will flip the axes to make the histogram horizontal\n  xlab(\"First Letter\") +\n  ylab(\"Total Count\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Horizontal Histogram of Counts by First Letter of First Name (2011-2019)\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThis horizontal histogram shows the frequency of the first letter of first names spanning the years 2011 to 2019 in NYC.From the plot, we can see the first letter ‘a’ is the longest, indicating it is the most common first letter for a first name in this dataset.

A letter with dots that are far apart indicates a larger disparity between the number of males and females with names starting with that letter."

We can see that Hispanic has the longest average name length overall, Asian and pacific islander has the lowest average name length. The trend of average name length across each Ethnicity is decreasing over years.\n\n\n3.4.3 Scatter Plot of Average Name Length by each Gender over years\n\n\nCode\nggplot(avg_name_length_by_gender, aes(x = Year.of.Birth, y = Average_Length, color = Gender)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(avg_name_length_by_gender$Year.of.Birth),\n                                  max(avg_name_length_by_gender$Year.of.Birth), by = 1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Average Name Length Over Years by Gender\",\n       x = \"Year of Birth\",\n       y = \"Average Name Length\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot, x-axis is the year of birth, with y-axis showing average name length and colored lines represent each gender. We can see that female has higher average name length than male from 2011-2019. The overall trend of average name length for both male and female is decreasing.\n\n\n3.4.4 Heatmap of Average Name Length by Gender and Ethnicity Over Years\n\n\nCode\navg_name_length_data &lt;- combined_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year.of.Birth, Gender, Ethnicity) %&gt;%\n  summarize(Average_Length = mean(Name_Length, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Year.of.Birth', 'Gender'. You can override\nusing the `.groups` argument.\n\n\nCode\n# Create the heatmap\nggplot(avg_name_length_data, aes(x = Year.of.Birth, y = Gender, fill = Average_Length)) +\n  geom_tile() + \n  facet_wrap(~ Ethnicity, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"black\", mid = \"white\", high = \"red\", midpoint = 5.8) + \n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Average Name Length by Gender and Ethnicity Over Years\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Gender\", fill = \"Average Name Length\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(avg_name_length_data$Year.of.Birth), \n                                  max(avg_name_length_data$Year.of.Birth), by = 1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe x-axis represents Year of Birth and the y-axis shows Gender, then faceted by Ethnicity and fill with the average name length with low in black, high in red color. From the heatmap, we can see that male Asian and Pacific Islander has the lowest average name length over years, female Hispanic has the longest average name length over years comparing to all. It’s worth notifying that female white NonHispanic has high name average name length in 2011 but then keep decreasing to 2019. Same for female black NonHispanic, who had relatively long average name length from 2011 to 2016 and then drop to relatively low in 2019. This sudden changes may related to some socioeconomic change. The average name length of Asian and Pacific Island seem to be all slightly below overall average name length."
